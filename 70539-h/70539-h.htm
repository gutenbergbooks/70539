FISHERMEN.</h2>
</div>


<h3 title="PART I.">IN TWO PARTS.—PART I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> herring-fishery has been prosecuted more or
less by the inhabitants of this country for several
hundred years, and the industry has been long
recognised not only as an important factor in
the food-supply of the country, but as one of
the most valuable export trades in Scotland. The
catching of herrings received a good deal of attention
from the fishing population last century;
but as the prosecution of the fishing was marked
by great irregularities, the fishermen became disheartened
at the repeated failures in the catch,
and being unacquainted with any proper mode
of curing and salting herrings that would have
enabled them to take advantage of prolific seasons,
the industry began to languish and decay. The
government, however, incited by the success of
enterprising Dutchmen engaged in the fishery,
saw the prospects of developing, under enlightened
auspices and unmeasured energy, a vast
sphere of operations; and with the view of
encouraging both fishermen and fishcurers to
engage in the industry, an Act of Parliament
was passed in 1750, and another in 1753, offering
substantial bounties to all boats employed in the
herring-fishery; which was followed up in 1809
by payment of a bounty of two shillings for
every barrel of herrings cured, accompanied by
an allowance of two and eightpence per barrel
exported. From 1815 to 1826 the export rate
was deleted; but the bounty per barrel cured
was in the last-mentioned year raised to four
shillings; while in the four succeeding years, a
yearly reduction of one shilling took place; and
in 1830, when the trade was fairly established,
the government bounties were abolished.</p>

<p>The fostering care bestowed upon the herring-trade
was fruitful of great results; and our countrymen,
who had looked upon the Dutch fishery,
with all its technicalities, as quite unapproachable,
were gratified to find that the Scotch herring-industry
was destined to take first rank
both in extent and excellence of cure. What
was still more satisfactory to those who had
seen it in its struggling days, instead of requiring
a continuance of state aid, it was soon able
to repay all advances made from the revenue
arising from fees paid by fishcurers for receiving
the government brand certifying the contents
and quality of the barrels, the annual income of
which now averages nearly eight thousand pounds.</p>

<p>The regular prosecution of the fishing on the
north and north-east coasts may be said not to
have commenced till 1815; but from that date, it
has been looked upon as a staple industry; and
its success or failure has influenced to an enormous
extent the comfort or poverty of the communities
inhabiting the smaller towns scattered
along the eastern shores of Scotland. In the
early part of this century, the quantity of fish
salted presented a very sober account; and in
1810, the grand total cured in Scotland, England,
and the Isle of Man was only 90,185 barrels;
while in 1851, the total for Scotland and the
Isle of Man was 594,031 barrels. From 1851
till 1870, a period of inactivity prevailed, and
the official statistics year after year were abundant
proof that the spirit of enterprise was sadly
deficient, or that the notoriously capricious herrings
had betaken themselves to other waters.
Whether the deficiency in the catch was attributable
to lack of energy on the part of curers and
fishermen, or a long-continued scarcity of fish,
is a problem yet unsolved; but it remains on
record that the total quantity cured in 1851
was 594,031 barrels; while in 1869 it had only
increased to 675,143 barrels. In 1870, Scotland
alone produced 833,160 barrels; while in the
season of 1884, the total quantity cured reached
the enormous figures of 1,697,000 barrels!</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that this great fishing, which
is now the mainstay of a vast population extending
round the shores of Scotland, has gone on
progressing till it has reached a position entitling
it to rank among the greatest industries of the
country. The money value of the fishing presents
a fairly intelligent view of the progress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">{306}</span>
made during the last fifty years in its prosecution;
and the figures given confirm the inexhaustible
riches of the sea, and prove the boundless
deep to be a mine of wealth, only now beginning
to receive the attention which it deserves.
The value of the fishing in 1810 was about
seventy thousand pounds; and though it was
subject to reverses now and again, it gradually
gained in dimensions until 1851, when its value
was half a million sterling! In 1870, the catch
yielded about nine hundred and sixteen thousand
five hundred pounds; whereas in 1884 the
total quantity cured represented a sum of two
million one hundred and twenty-one thousand
three hundred and forty-six pounds; which is
equal to the rentals of the counties of Aberdeen,
Banff, Elgin, Nairn, Inverness, Cromarty, Ross,
Sutherland, and Caithness—or the annual value of
nearly a half of that of the total area of Scotland.</p>

<p>Along with other improvements, the increase
in the number and size of the herring-boats
forms an interesting feature in the trade, and
is a striking proof of the immense resources at
the command of the fishermen. Not only has
the numerical strength of the fleet increased
greatly, but the size and style of the boats have
also changed immensely; and the craft measuring
thirty-five feet of keel and fourteen feet of beam,
used in 1830-50, have given place to handsome
and substantially built vessels, averaging fifty-six
feet from stem to stern, and not under
eighteen and a half feet of beam, whose burden
runs from twenty-five to forty registered tons.
Although the demand for herrings has gone
on increasing steadily, the tastes of former large
consumers have shown remarkable changes, and
those—especially the inhabitants of Ireland—who
in the early days of the fishing were the best
customers of the Scotch curers, now but very
moderately recognise salt herrings as an article
of food. In 1821, the exportation of salted
herrings to Ireland was 125,445 barrels; to the
continent, 89,524; and to places out of Europe,
79,836: whereas in 1851 the figures were, Ireland,
66,138; continent, 198,403; places out of
Europe, 2367: and in 1884, Ireland, 34,000;
continent, 1,149,000; places out of Europe, 960
barrels. The radical changes in the quantities
of fish consumed at the different markets in the
course of half a century are rather striking; but
Ireland has, it is said, largely substituted bacon
and other cheap food for the once much-prized
fish; while the almost complete collapse of the
colonial trade is directly caused by the emancipation
of the West Indian slaves, who were provided
by their masters with salted herrings as
the leading article of fare, and who, in order
to efface all recollections of their former degradation,
studiously avoided touching the herring
after their liberty was secured!</p>

<p>Although not the rule, a number of fishermen
often commence fishing for herrings at various
ports on the east coast early in July; but it is
generally not until about the 20th of the month
that the fishermen’s regular engagements commence
and operations are begun in earnest. At
that date the fishcurers are bound to receive the
fish at twenty shillings per cran—one cran being
equal to a capacity of thirty-seven gallons, and
reckoned to contain about eight hundred herrings—from
early morning till twelve o’clock midnight;
and should the weather prove favourable
and the shoals abundant, a single crew of energetic
men have often earned no less than one hundred
pounds in the first week of the fishing, and continued
the work with such success, that at the
end of the season of eight weeks, a sum of five
hundred pounds stood at their credit in the
fishcurer’s books. In recent years, the boats have
largely increased at the leading ports of Fraserburgh,
Peterhead, Aberdeen, and Wick, where
the numbers employed during the season vary
from seven or eight hundred at Fraserburgh,
down to four hundred at Aberdeen—not to mention
the enormous recent increase at Shetland—each
boat being manned by six men and one boy.
The extent of netting in use has also largely
increased.</p>

<p>For a considerable period of the season the
boats prosecute the fishing on the banks from
forty to sixty miles away, gradually nearing the
shore as the season advances; but in no season
imitating the modest efforts of the fishermen of
forty or fifty years ago, who never ventured more
than ten or fifteen miles off, with the result that
the fish, undisturbed in their inward course, were
caught in large quantities quite close to the shore.
With regard to those days, many of the old people
now living on the Aberdeenshire coast have a
vivid recollection of the extraordinary excitement
that existed in the fishing-towns one or two generations
ago when the word passed round that
‘a body’ of herrings had at length appeared in
the bay, the indications of which were a dense
flock of seagulls to be seen preying upon the
finny tribe, or a large shoal of whales pursuing
the fish—the manœuvres of the former attracting
the fishermen to their mark, and afforded an
interesting sight to those on the shore.</p>

<p>At this stage of its history, one of the most serious
drawbacks to the prosperity of the herring-fishery
was the immense shoals of dogfish which
regularly visited the north-east coast during the
months of July and August, to the almost complete
prostration of the fishermen’s efforts; for
not only did those rapacious fishes greatly destroy
the nets in their pursuit of food, but the herrings,
which seemed to have a wholesome dread
of this enemy, immediately disappeared from
their usual haunts whenever the dogfish arrived
upon the ground. It was no uncommon thing
to see boat-loadfuls of dogfish brought in daily
by the fishermen, from whom they were purchased
by farmers and crofters for manuring
the land, and also for the purpose of providing
oil for domestic uses; as, before paraffine or
candles had come within the reach of all, a
great portion of the lamp-oil used by the poorer
classes, on the Aberdeenshire coast at least, was
extracted from dogfish. After having visited
the coast bound by the German Ocean more
or less regularly for sixty or seventy years, the
dogfish mysteriously disappeared in 1866; and
though they are still met with at intervals by
fishermen at the west coast herring-fishing (Lewis
and Barra) and at Shetland, they have never
again returned to the east coast; a freak of nature
which has puzzled the most intelligent fishcurer
or fisherman to explain, but which has wielded
an influence for good scarcely conceivable, since
the disappearance of these pests from the adjacent
seas marked the setting in of a tide of prosperity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">{307}</span>
in the trade which has never again receded. The
greatly increased size and number of boats, and
the competition for herrings existing in the trade,
have rendered inshore fishing next to impossible;
and as it is generally the case that herrings are
now more abundant at sea than near the land,
the anxiety to secure good takes is year by year
drawing the fishermen to more distant grounds;
hence, there are reasonable prospects that ere
many years have elapsed, the prosecution of the
fishing will have developed into the regular employment
of large smacks and steam-craft able to
venture great distances to sea, and, if need be,
remain there till a sufficient catch has been
obtained.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Having given a short sketch of the rise and
progress of the Scotch herring business, some
notes on the social aspect of the industry, and
a general description of the present mode of
catching and curing the fish, will probably prove
interesting to those who have not been privileged
to visit any of the great fishing-towns during
the months of July and August, a time of each
year when the mighty herring constitutes the
sole topic of conversation.</p>

<p>At the harbours of the herring-towns in the
end of June and beginning of July, boats are
arriving from north, south, and west laden with
all kinds of household goods; and uppermost are
the fisher-folk’s beds and blankets, upon which
are lying the wives and children, who have been
taken by this route to save the expense of a
trip by rail, but whose condition, from the effects
of stormy seas, often demonstrates the folly of
the fishermen’s financial policy. In addition to
the fishermen and their belongings, every train
brings hundreds of Highlanders from Inverness,
Sutherland, Ross, and the Isles in search of
employment on board the boats; and they, in
conjunction with the influx of crofters (to be
engaged for carting purposes), tramps, itinerant
dealers, preaching representatives of various denominations,
&amp;c., soon swell the normal population
by many thousands, and form as motley a
crowd as can be well imagined. The fishing-towns
of Aberdeenshire and more northern ports
awaken, after a protracted period of somnolence,
to the fact that the season of activity has arrived;
and the streets which formerly looked bare and
deserted, now teem with men, women, and children,
all drawn together to share in the spoils
of the deep. Order in such a miscellaneous population
is sometimes not easily maintained, and the
surging and unruly masses which on a Saturday
night congregate about the leading thoroughfares
tax the energies of the police to the uttermost;
and if the Highlanders be on the ‘warpath’
from the effects of too liberal potations of
their own ‘mountain dew,’ the question of local
government has to be settled by military force—an
instance of which took place at Fraserburgh
in 1874, when fully a thousand Highlanders in an
infuriated condition wrecked the police station,
bombarded the town-house, and threatened to
burn the town, and were only brought to their
senses by the arrival of a detachment of soldiers
from Aberdeen.</p>

<p>The evening of the seventh day of the week
is invariably one of confusion, noise, and fight
in every large fishing-town; but throughout the
other nights, all frivolities are cast aside, and
the single aim of the whole community is to
secure as rich a harvest of herrings as possible.
Under ordinary circumstances, the sight afforded
by the departure from the harbour of so many
craft crawling lazily along in twos, threes, and
half-dozens, is very pretty; but when the
prospects of a good fishing are exercising the
fishermen’s minds, and every one is anxious to
reach the fishing-ground early, the excitement
and competition among the fishermen to secure
a good start, transforms the harbour channel into
a scene of the wildest confusion, where the fishermen
shout, threaten, and at times deal blows at
each other, playing tragedy and comedy in turns,
to the intense delight of those watching their
movements from the piers. Should the weather
be favourable, the boats keep constantly streaming
from the harbour-mouth; and if a fresh breeze
prevails, a very short time will suffice to fill the
bay with hundreds of the handy little craft, gaily
ploughing their eastward course to the fishing-ground.
By-and-by the horizon for a considerable
stretch will be dotted with their brown
sails, still holding onwards; and only when the
sea and clouds join hands, do they finally disappear
in the wide waste of waters.</p>

<p>On leaving the harbour and getting the sails
set and trimmed, the crew of the craft betake
themselves to comfortable quarters among the
nets and spare sails lying about the deck,
where local yarns are told, and the Highlanders
sing Gaelic songs, or rehearse the leading incidents
of their life in the Western Isles since
last ‘she’ was in the east coast; but as the
fishing-ground is neared, the stories cease, and
every one, from the skipper down to the
‘scummer’ boy—the lad who is employed with
a small hand-net to pick any herrings out of
the water that happen to fall from the nets—eagerly
scans the water in hopes of descrying
indications of fish. Should the wished-for
appearances be discovered, so much the better;
but it often happens that no certain proofs of
the existence of fish are obtained, and after
reaching a distance where fish are supposed to
abound, the sails are lowered, and the men
commence to cast the nets into the sea in the
dusk of the evening. In doing this, a small
portion of the sail is hoisted, and while the craft
moves slowly through the water, the fishermen
continue casting their nets overboard, until their
fleet of say, fifty, nets, attached to one another,
and extending in a direct line for a length of
two thousand yards, are shot, the whole hanging
perpendicularly in the water, and suspended from
a rope, to which is fastened skin or metallic buoys
floating on the surface of the water. When the
whole of the nets belonging to the boats engaged
at a large station are set, the sea for a stretch of
many miles is one complete network, from which
the herrings can scarcely escape; and the work
falling upon the fishermen nightly in shooting and
hauling their nets may be guessed from the fact
that the netting used by the Scotch fishermen, if
stretched in a direct line, would extend ten thousand
miles, or something like three times across
the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Having got the nets safely into the deep,
the mast is lowered, the light hoisted, and
everything put into its proper place for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">{308}</span>
night; and as the craft drifts slowly along with
the wind or tide, surrounded by hundreds of
other fishing-boats, not a sound is heard save
the occasional whistle of a steamer slowly threading
its way through the floating hamlet, or the
shrill cry of the expectant seabirds. On board
the boats, the crews have retired to rest, with
the exception of one or two left to act as the
watch, but who, when their conversation runs
dry, invariably seek change in the arms of
Morpheus, and trust to providence to fulfil the
duties which they had undertaken. Once or
twice during the night the skipper causes a
net or two to be pulled up; and if the prospects
of a successful fishing are good, the position
occupied is retained; but if no herrings
are in the nets, it is not uncommon for the
crew to remove to another spot, in hopes of
meeting in with better luck, where the labour of
shooting the nets has again to be undergone.</p>

<p>As the morning breaks, the crews bestir themselves,
and at an early hour the work of hauling
commences, which being accomplished sooner or
later, according to the weight of fish secured,
all canvas is set upon the craft; and as she
speeds steadily through the sea, causing the
wavelets rippling at the bow to sparkle brilliantly
in the morning sun, the crew, all unconscious
of the glorious panorama spread before
them, actively engage in shaking the herrings
out of the nets and otherwise preparing for discharging
their catch on reaching the harbour.
As the net hangs like a curtain in the water,
herring in their progress get their heads into
the meshes, whence they cannot retreat, and are
thus held captive till the nets are hauled on
board and the fish shaken into the hold. On
many occasions the herrings strike so densely
that almost a whole complement of nets sink to
the bottom, which often entails a loss upon a
single crew of from one hundred to one hundred
and fifty pounds; while at other times the
craft are so deeply laden with the precious
freight, that they run the harbour for a distance
of perhaps forty miles, with the water occasionally
playing upon their decks, and only saved
from foundering by the extreme calmness of the
weather. In many seasons, the fishing proves
a complete blank for a protracted period; and
as the whole community in the fishing-towns
is entirely dependent upon the success of the
industry, such occasions throw the spirits of
everybody below zero, and the usual bustle and
smiling faces give place to solemn countenances;
and curers, coopers, and others stand in groups
on the piers and at the street corners discussing
the fishermen’s chances and prophesying the result
of next week’s fishing.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> human eye ever again beheld Wilberforce
Whitaker, alive or dead. The torrent that had
washed down the gap in the narrow horsepath
tore away with it in the course of that evening’s
rain a great mass of tottering earth that had
long trembled on the edge of the precipice; and
when next day the governor’s servants went
down in awed silence to hunt among the débris
for the mangled body, they found nothing but
a soaked hat on the road behind, and a broken
riding-whip close to the huge rent that yawned
across the path by the crumbling ledge of newly
fallen clay. Louis Delgado alone could tell of
what had happened; and in Louis Delgado’s
opinion, Dr Whitaker’s crushed and shapeless
body must be lying below under ten thousand
tons of landslip rubbish. ‘I see de gentleman
haltin’ on de brink ob de hole,’ he said a hundred
times over to his gossips next day, ‘and
I tink I hear him call aloud someting as him
go ober de tip ob de big precipice. But it
doan’t sound to me ezackly as if him scared
and shoutin’; ’pears more as if him singing to
hisself a kind ob mounful miserable psalm-tune.’</p>

<p>In tropical countries, people are accustomed
to hurricanes and thunderstorms and landslips
and sudden death in every form—does not the
Church service even contain that weirdly suggestive
additional clause among the petitions of
the litany, ‘From earthquake, tempest, and violent
commotion, good Lord, deliver us?’—and
so nobody ever tried to dig up Wilberforce
Whitaker’s buried body; and if they had tried,
they would never have succeeded in the attempt,
for a thousand tons of broken fragments lay on
top of it, and crushed it to atoms beneath them.
Poor old Bobby felt the loss acutely, after his
childish fashion, for nearly a fortnight, and then
straightway proceeded to make love as usual to
Miss Seraphina and the other ladies, and soon
forgot his whole trouble in that one congenial
lifelong occupation.</p>

<p>Nora Dupuy did not so quickly recover the
shock that the mulatto’s sudden and almost
supernatural death had given her system. It
was many weeks before she began to feel like
herself again, or to trust herself in a room alone
for more than a very few minutes together.
Born West Indian as she was, and therefore superstitious,
she almost feared that Dr Whitaker’s
ghost would come to plead his cause with her
once more, as he himself had pleaded with her
that last unhappy evening on the Italian terrace.
It wasn’t her fault, to be sure, that she had been
the unwitting cause of his death; and yet in
her own heart she felt to herself almost as if
she had deliberately and intentionally killed him.
That insuperable barrier of race that had stood
so effectually in his way while he was still alive
was partly removed now that she could no
longer see him in person; and more than once,
Nora found herself in her own room with tears
standing in both her eyes for the poor mulatto
she could never possibly or conceivably have
married.</p>

<p>As for Tom Dupuy, he couldn’t understand
such delicate shades and undertones of feeling
as those which came so naturally to Nora; and
he had therefore a short and easy explanation
of his own for his lively little cousin’s altered
demeanour. ‘Nora was in love with that infernal
nigger fellow,’ he said confidently over and over
again to his uncle Theodore. ‘You take my
word for it, she was head over ears in love
with him; that’s about the size of it. And that
evening when she behaved so disgracefully with
him on the terrace at the governor’s, he proposed
to her, and she accepted him, as sure as gospel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">{309}</span>
If I hadn’t threatened him with a good sound
horsewhipping, and driven him away from the
house in a deuce of a funk, so that he went
off with his tail between his legs, and broke his
neck over a precipice in that terrible thunderstorm—you
mark my words, Uncle Theodore—she’d
have gone off, as I always said she would,
and she’d have ended by marrying a woolly-headed
brown man.’</p>

<p>Mr Theodore Dupuy, for his part, considered
that even to mention the bare possibility of
such a disgrace within the bosom of the family
was an insult to the pure blood of the Dupuys
that his nephew Tom ought to have been the
last man on earth to dream of perpetrating.</p>

<p>Time rolled on, however, month after month,
and gradually Nora began to recover something
of her natural gaiety. Even deep impressions
last a comparatively short time with bright young
girls; and before six months more had fairly
rolled by, Nora was again the same gay, light,
merry, dancing little thing that she had always
been, in England or in Trinidad.</p>

<p>One morning, about twelve months after Nora’s
first arrival in the island, the English mail
brought a letter for her father, which he read
with evident satisfaction, and then handed it
contentedly to Nora across the breakfast-table.
Nora recognised the crest and monogram in a
moment with a faint flutter: she had seen them
once before, a year ago, in England. They were
Harry Noel’s. But the postmark was Barbadoes.
She read the letter eagerly and hastily.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>’—it ran—‘I have had the pleasure
already of meeting some members of your family
on the other side of the Atlantic’—that was an
overstatement, Nora thought to herself quietly;
the plural for the singular—‘and as I have come
out to look after some property of my father’s
here in Barbadoes, I propose to run across to
Trinidad also, by the next steamer, and gain
a little further insight into the habits and
manners of the West Indies. My intention is
to stop during my stay with my friend Mr
Hawthorn, who—as you doubtless know—holds
a district judgeship or something of the sort
somewhere in Trinidad. But I think it best
at the same time to inclose a letter of introduction
to yourself from General Sir Henry
Laboutillière, whom I daresay you remember
as formerly commandant of Port-of-Spain when
the Hundred and Fiftieth were in your island.
I shall do myself the honour of calling upon
you very shortly after my arrival, and am meanwhile,
very faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Harry Noel</span>.’<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>The letter of introduction which accompanied
this very formal note briefly set forth that Sir
Walter Noel, Mr Noel’s father, was an exceedingly
old and intimate friend of the writer’s,
and that he would feel much obliged if Mr
Dupuy would pay young Mr Noel any attentions
in his power during his short stay in the
island of Trinidad.</p>

<p>It would be absurd to deny that Nora felt
flattered. She blushed, and blushed, and blushed
again, with unmistakable pleasure. To be sure,
she had refused Harry Noel; and if he were
to ask her again, even now, she would refuse
him a second time. But no girl on earth is
wholly proof in her own heart against resolute
persistence. Even if she doesn’t care a pin for
a man from the matrimonial point of view,
yet provided only he is ‘nice’ and ‘eligible,’
she feels naturally flattered by the mere fact
that he pays her attention. If the attention
is marked and often renewed, the flattery is
all the deeper, subtler, and more effective. But
here was Harry Noel, pursuant of his threat
(or should we rather say his promise?), following
her up right across the Atlantic, and coming
to lay siege to her heart with due formalities
once more, in the very centre of her own stronghold!
Yes, Nora was undeniably pleased. Of
course, she didn’t care for him; oh, dear, no,
not the least little bit in the world, really;
but still, even if you don’t want to accept a
lover, you know, it is at anyrate pleasant to
have the opportunity of a second time cruelly
rejecting him. So Nora blushed, and smiled to
herself, and blushed over again, and felt by no
means out of humour at Harry Noel’s evident
persistence.</p>

<p>‘Well, Nora?’ her father said to her, eyeing
her interrogatively. ‘What do you think of
it?’</p>

<p>‘I think, papa, Mr Noel’s a very gentlemanly,
nice young man, of a very good old English
family.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, Nora: I know that, of course. I
see as much from Sir Henry Laboutillière’s letter
of introduction. But what I mean is, we must
have him here, at Orange Grove, naturally,
mustn’t we? It would never do, you see, to let
a member of the English aristocracy’—Mr Dupuy
dwelt lovingly upon these latter words with some
unction, as preachers dwell with lingering cadence
upon the special shibboleths of their own particular
sect or persuasion—‘go to stop with such
people as your coloured friends over yonder at
Mulberry, the Hawthorns.’</p>

<p>Nora was silent.</p>

<p>‘Why don’t you answer me, miss?’ Mr Dupuy
asked testily, after waiting for a moment in
silent expectation.</p>

<p>‘Because I will never speak to you about
my own friends, papa, when you choose to talk
of them in such untrue and undeserved language.’</p>

<p>Mr Dupuy smiled urbanely. He was in a
good humour. It flattered him, too, to think
that when members of the English aristocracy
came out to Trinidad they should naturally select
him, Theodore Dupuy, Esquire, of Orange Grove,
as the proper person towards whom to look for
hospitality. The fame of the fighting Dupuys
was probably not unknown to the fashionable
world even in London. They were recognised
and talked about. So Mr Dupuy merely smiled
a bland smile of utter obliviousness, and observed
in the air (as men do when they are addressing
nobody in particular): ‘Coloured people are
always coloured people, I suppose, whether they’re
much or little coloured; just as a dog’s always a
dog whether he’s a great big heavy St Bernard
or a little snarling snapper of a Skye terrier.
But anyhow, it’s quite clear to me individually
that we can’t let this young Mr Noel—a
person of distinction, Nora, a person of distinction—go
and stop at any other house in this
island except here at Orange Grove, I assure
you, my dear. Tom or I must certainly go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">{310}</span>
down to meet the steamer, and bring him up
here bodily in the buggy, before your friend Mr
Hawthorn—about whose personal complexion I
prefer to say absolutely nothing, for good or
for evil—has time to fasten on him and drag
him away by main force to his own dwelling-place.’
(Mr Dupuy avoided calling Mulberry
Lodge a house on principle; for in the West
Indies, it is an understood fact that only white
people live in houses.)</p>

<p>‘But, papa,’ Nora cried, ‘you really mustn’t.
I don’t think you ought to bring him up here.
Wouldn’t it—well, you know, wouldn’t it look
just a little pointed, considering there’s nobody
else at all living in the house except you and
me, you know, papa?’</p>

<p>‘My dear,’ Mr Dupuy said, not unkindly, ‘a
member of the English aristocracy, when he comes
to Trinidad, ought to be received in the house
of one of the recognised gentry of the island,
and not in that—well, not in the dwelling-place
of any person not belonging to the aristocracy
of Trinidad. <i>Noblesse oblige</i>, Nora; <i>noblesse
oblige</i>, remember. Besides, when you consider
the relation in which you already stand to your
cousin Tom, my dear—why, an engaged young
lady, of course, an engaged young lady occupies
nearly the same position in that respect as if
she were already actually married.’</p>

<p>‘But I’m not engaged, papa,’ Nora answered
earnestly. ‘And I never will be to Tom Dupuy,
if I die unmarried, either.’</p>

<p>‘That, my dear,’ Mr Dupuy responded blandly,
looking at her with parental fondness, ‘is a question
on which I venture to think myself far
better qualified to form an opinion than a mere
girl of barely twenty. Tom and I have arranged
between us, as I have often already pointed out
to you, that the family estates ought on all accounts
to be reunited in your persons. As soon
as you are twenty-two, my dear, we propose that
you should marry. Meanwhile, it can only arouse
unseemly differences within the family to discuss
the details of the question prematurely. I
have made up my mind, and will not go back
upon it. A Dupuy never does. As to this
young Mr Noel who’s coming from Barbadoes,
I shall go down myself to the next steamer,
and look out to offer him our hospitality immediately
on his arrival, before any coloured people—I
mention no names—can seize upon the opportunity
of intercepting him, and carrying him off
forcibly against his will, bag and baggage, to
their own dwelling-places.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOME_RUSTIC_NAMES_OF_FLOWERS">SOME RUSTIC NAMES OF FLOWERS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Who</span> does not love the country names of old-fashioned
flowers better than those by which
botanists and florists call them? By old-fashioned
flowers—if forms perennially renewed can ever
be called old-fashioned—are meant the flowers
our oldest poets praise, and whose simple charms
find a place in the songs of modern ones—flowers,
the roots of which the old Flemings
and the proscribed of Nantes brought with them
in their enforced migration to this country, and
which, like the industries they introduced, flourished
into brighter bloom and strength than in
the Fatherland. Some of the rustic names of
these old flowers have a quaint prettiness and
meaning in them, like the pet names of little
children, which are at once piquant and endearing;
and as some are local, others little known,
and others, again, nearly obsolete, and likely
to be wholly so in another generation or two,
one is interested in endeavouring to preserve
them.</p>

<p>The ‘Falfalaries’ (checkered snake’s head) of
old Shropshire people are properly spoken of by
their children’s children as ‘Fritillaries;’<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and
bright-looking blushful ‘Pretty Betty,’ indigenous
to the Kentish chalk, and familiar to many persons
by this name, is now, thanks to botany and Board
Schools, correctly known as ‘Red Valerian.’ We,
however, who have known it from childhood by
its homelier name, will know it by no other; for
us, it will always be ‘Pretty Betty,’ and suggestive
of the high bloom on the hypothetical maiden’s
cheek in honour of whom it was so named. In
Chaucer’s time, it was crudely called ‘Setwale,’
or ‘Set-a-wall,’ from its well-known habit of
cresting old castles and other crumbling walls,
and of growing above gray posterns and old
garden-gates, whence, from the tender ‘Good-nights’
not unusual at such places, it probably
got its Shropshire name of ‘Kiss-at-the-wicket,’
and its Surrey synonym, ‘Kiss-behind-the-garden-gate.’
The variegated ‘Ribbon-grass’ of our gardens,
anciently called—but that was when the rood
of Boxley flourished, and village maidens, knowing
no other literature, read their saints’ calendar in
flowers—‘Our Lady’s Laces,’ had become, when
Parkinson wrote, ‘Painted’ or ‘Ladies’ Laces,’
which makes all the difference. In many places
it has the common name of ‘Gardener’s Garters;’
but in a corner of Kent not far from the
Weald, where many old-world ways and words
are cherished, it has the pretty, pert, but apposite
one of ‘Match-me-if-you-can’—a name that
prompted the examination of a dozen blades of
it, only to discover that, by some exquisite diversity
of arrangement of the creamy white and pale-green
stripes, not one of the delicately striated
leaves exactly resembled another.</p>

<p>‘I won’t have it called “London-pride,”’ said
the eighty-year-old proprietress of a garden, once
fuller of bloom and colour and sweetness than
any other we have known; but that was before
sight failed its owner. ‘What have we country-folk
and simple flowers to do with “London-pride?”
For my part, I like it best by its old
Kentish name of “None-so-pretty.”’ If any
doubt the fitness of the sobriquet, let them take
the trouble to microscopically examine the minute
painted and jewelled corolla of this flower, and
assure themselves how truly it deserves the
appellation.</p>

<p>No country garden is without ‘Honesty,’ or
‘White Satin-flower’ as it is sometimes called,
from the silvery lustre of its large circularly
shaped <i>saliques</i>, which, when dried, were used to
dress up fireplaces in summer, and decorate the
chimney-mantels of cottages and village inns.
Our aged friend had another name for this plant
also, and called it ‘Money-in-both-pockets.’ The
curious seed-vessels, which grow in pairs, and are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">{311}</span>
semi-transparent, show the flat disc-shaped seeds
like little coins within them, an appearance which
no doubt originated the name.</p>

<p>Reminiscent of the times to which we just now
alluded, when holy names hung about the hedgerows,
and the blossoming of plants recalled sacred
seasons and events, the lilac in Devonshire bears
the name of ‘Whitsuntide Flower;’ the country-people
know it by no other. There <i>Cardamine
pratensis</i>, Shakspeare’s ‘Lady-smocks,’ the ‘Cuckoo-flower’
of old Gerarde, whose blossoms border the
streams and rivulets in spring ‘all silver-white,’
like lengths of bleaching linen, is known as
‘Milkmaids;’ and in the same county the ‘Foxglove’
becomes ‘Folk’s-glove’ or ‘Fairy-glove;’
while in Ireland, children call the drooping
tubular freckled bells ‘Fairy thimbles,’ and are
careful not to meddle with them after sunset, on
pain of being pinched by the ‘good-people.’</p>

<p>The milk-white ‘Candytuft’ (<i>Iberis amara</i>)
grows plentifully on stony upland fields in Berkshire
and Oxfordshire. Once, in the latter county,
when we were gathering some of it from a field
in which some women were weeding, one of
them remarked to another that she should not
have liked to have done so when she was a young
woman; upon which we inquired its name, and
was told, almost reluctantly, ‘Poverty’—a most
expressive name; for it loves best a poor and arid
soil, and has its botanical name from its intense
bitterness. Evidently, village lads and lasses had
from early times an unwritten language of flowers,
and this was one of its phrases.</p>

<p>As our readers know, ‘Pansy’ is a very old
name for the ‘Heart’s-ease,’ as old at least as Queen
Elizabeth’s time, and probably older. Spenser
writes of the ‘pretty pauncy;’ and Ophelia gives
it ‘for thought.’ It is a plant of many names.
Shakspeare twice calls it ‘Love-in-idleness.’
Poor, simple, pious folk, seeing its three lower
petals rayed like a ‘glory,’ called it ‘Herb of
the Trinity.’ The vagrant habit of the plant
procured it the name of ‘Kit-run-the-streets,’
which appellation it has not wholly lost in
country-places. Rustics also call it ‘Two-faces-under-a-hood.’
But it was as ‘Heart’s-ease’ we
first knew it, a name that gives sweet force to
that other old-world one, ‘Call-me-to-you,’ which
without it had been meaningless.</p>

<p>Of local names for flowers, one of the prettiest
we know is that by which a Dorsetshire girl
designated the ‘Michaelmas Daisy’—a name full
of unconscious poetry; she called it ‘Summer’s
Farewell.’ ‘We shall not have many more nosegays
this year, ma’am; I see “Summer’s Farewell”
is blowing;’ and upon desiring to see the unknown
flower, she pointed out the familiar ‘Michaelmas
Daisy.’</p>

<p>In Wiltshire, the children give the names of
‘Rushlights’ and ‘Fairy-candles’ to the ‘Trip-madam’
of our ancestors, the small fleshy-leaved
erect stems and terminal flowers with spreading
anthers of the yellow sedum (or stonecrop), frequent
on old walls and housetops; and to the
subtle child-fancy, we have no doubt the resemblance
is sufficiently strong to set them all alight
on summer nights.</p>

<p>The ‘Danewort’ or Dwarf-elder is in some
districts said to be so called because the people
fancy it sprung from the blood of the Danes
slain in battle; and that if, upon a certain
day of the year, you cut it, it bleeds. It is
noteworthy that the large terminal cymes of
this plant, which loves waste places, are of a
purplish colour, the berries black, and that the
juice of the flowering stems, like the fruit, produces
a blood-like stain.</p>

<p>The curious corruption of ‘Fritillary’ to ‘Falfalarie,’
with which we started, is easily understood;
but who would recognise the poetically
named ‘Narcissus’ under the homely guise of
‘White Nancies,’ the common name for it in
Shropshire gardens? We had rather it kept its
pretty rustic name of ‘daffodil,’ a name inwoven
in many a garland of old English verse, and
sweetly suggestive of woods, and nut-boughs
sparkling with buds, and village children, and
the fresh young joy of spring. The name daffodil
is now generally applied to the species with bright
yellow flowers.</p>

<p>Another old-world plant included in these days
under the generic name of <i>Campanula</i>, and which
in many parts was known as ‘Country-bells,’
keeps in its Kentish name of ‘Canterbury-bells’
a local legend; and is so called not only from
the prevalence of the plant in the neighbourhood
of the old sainted city, but because it was the
type of ‘Becket’s bells,’ which pilgrims to his
shrine carried away with them, in token of
their having been there. Another of its tribe,
better known than liked, has the quaint name of
‘Little-steeple-bell-flower,’ a picturesque name one
would not willingly blot out from floral nomenclature;
though its common one of ‘Rampions’
is quite good enough for it, and highly characteristic
of the exuberant mode in which its fleshy
and at the same time fibrous roots take possession
of the soil and overrun it. It is a dangerous
plant to admit into gardens, where its tall tapering
stem, beset with little watchet blue-bells, is
occasionally seen.</p>

<p>In the north of England, the wild hyacinth
of the south—sometimes erroneously called ‘Harebell’—with
its pendulous flowers underhanging
each other on one side only of its drooping
stem, has the curious name of ‘Ring-of-bells’
from a fancied resemblance (a writer in <i>Notes
and Queries</i> tells us) to the bells on which
King David is sometimes represented playing
in old wood-engravings. In Shropshire, the
fertile stems of the Horsetail (<i>Equisetum arvenses</i>),
which shoot up like brown pencils out of the
soil before the sterile ones appear, are called
‘Toadpipes’ by the children; and a similar
name is applied to them in many parts of
Scotland. In Shropshire, also, the chalk-white
flowers of the rock alyssum have the pretty
trivial name of ‘Summer Snow;’ and the scarlet
pimpernel, that trusted hydroscope of hind and
shepherd—of which Lord Bacon wrote: ‘There
is a small flower in the stubble-fields which
country-people call “Wincopipe,” which if it
openeth in the morning, you may be sure of a
fine day’—is ‘Wincopeep;’ which, methinks, to
use his lordship’s idiom, is the more correct of
the two, seeing the habit of the plant is to close
its petals when a rain-cloud dulls the sky, and
to open them wide in sunshine—alternations
suggestive of the name ‘Wink-and-peep,’ which
time has probably contracted. In some places it
is known as ‘the poor man’s weather-glass.’</p>

<p>In the same district, that fine sour relish of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">{312}</span>
our childhood, ‘Sorrel,’ is simply ‘Sour-dock;’
and the early Purple Orchis (<i>O. mascula</i>), with
its dark-green leaves plashed with brown, and
spikes of richly coloured flowers springing up
in cowslip-covered meadows, is hailed as ‘King’s
Fingers.’</p>

<p>The cowslip has in Shropshire the common
name of ‘Paigle,’ a name the derivation of
which no one appears to understand; but its
old Kentish name of ‘Culver-keys’ is unknown.
We have lately seen the meaning of this also
queried. It had its origin most probably in the
common country fashion of christening flowers,
in Gerarde’s time, from some fancied resemblance
in its drooping umbel of unopened flowers
to a ‘bunch of keys’ hanging from a ring or
girdle; just as the pendent clusters of ash-seeds
are called—we presume from the same idea—‘Ashen-keys;’
and as a bunch of keys must
belong to some one or some thing, why not to
the ‘culver,’ or wood-pigeon? In this fanciful
way we can imagine the pretty rustic name
of ‘Culver-key’ coming about; an hypothesis
wholly our own, and therefore open to correction.</p>

<p>It was after this fashion, Parkinson tells us, he
named the ‘Wild Clematis’ (<i>C. vitalba</i>), ‘Traveller’s
Joy,’ because it loves to spread green bowers in
hedgerows near villages and the habitations of
men. But whence came the name of ‘Roving
Sailor?’—one of the trivial ones for the ivy-leaved
Toad-flax (<i>Linaria cymbalaria</i>), the fine thread-like
runners of which hang from old garden-walls—those
of Hampton Court, for instance—bearing
in their season little solitary blue or purple
petaled flowers. No rustic would have so named
it; to him, its other appellations of ‘Hen-and-chickens,’
or ‘Mother-of-thousands,’ would have
been more natural. But ‘Roving Sailor’ savours
of that other element with which the husbandman
meddles not, and may have been bestowed by
some maritime superannuant, whose imagination
transformed the long streaming roots into cordage,
and the tiny blue-jacketed flowers into sailors
climbing it, while the straggling habit of the
plant completed the similitude.</p>

<p>Traditions die hard in country villages, and
faith in the specially remedial properties of plants
once dedicated to holy names and anniversaries
is by no means extinct amongst peasant-folk.
Thus, we were gravely informed last summer by
a cottager of our acquaintance, in the sweet hamlet
of Harbledown, in Kent, that there was nothing
for a green wound better than the leaves of
our ‘Saviour’s Flannel’ (or ‘Blanket’), a startling
name for the exquisitely soft, glaucous, green
leaves of what some persons secularly call ‘Mouse-ear,’
and which—to liken nature to art—resemble
in texture the finest silken plush, and retain their
softness and pliability for months after they are
gathered. It is often seen in borders, where its
silvery leaves and pale mauve-coloured flowers
render it effective.</p>

<p>Again, the great ‘White Lily’ (<i>Lilium candidum</i>),
the ‘Sceptre Lily’ of our time, ‘Our Lady’s
Lily’ in the past, of which the old masters made
such effective use in their pictures of the Virgin,
is in Shropshire still known as ‘Ascension Lily,’
an evident misnomer. It should be, remembering
the time of its blooming, the ‘Lily of the Annunciation.’
In the neighbourhood of the Wrekin it
has another name—it is the ‘Healing Lily;’ and
the curative virtue of the whole plant is firmly
believed in.</p>

<p>It was a pretty custom to name the plants after
the saints and holy seasons about whose anniversaries
they fell a-flowering. It saved some absurdities
and vulgarities in christening them, and
left us names so sweet and appropriate, that, like
the gillyflowers and sops-in-wine, sweetbrier, &amp;c.,
of the old poets, they will never become old or
inapt. Who would exchange ‘Christmas Rose’
for ‘Black Hellebore,’ or ‘Lent Lily’ for ‘Pseudo
Narcissus,’ or prefer ‘Anemone’ to ‘Easter-flower,’
or ‘Polygally’ to ‘Crosswort?’ (carried
on wands in the ancient perambulations of Rogation-week).
‘Whitsuntide Flower’ is a prettier
name than ‘Lilac,’ and ‘Michaelmas Daisy’ than
‘Aster Tradescanti,’ the one by which it was
known when Charles I. was king.</p>

<p>But these are not the purely rustic names
of plants with which we started. One more
example—a local one—and our personally formed
catalogue of them is ended. Any one who has
observed the regular height to which the garden
fumitory grows when planted against a wall,
forming a background of its soft, finely cut,
bright-green leaves, which overhang each other,
and the seemingly equal distances at which
its clusters of yellow or rose coloured flowers
depend, will at once perceive the fitness of its
quaint Shropshire name of ‘Ladies’ Needlework
Flower.’ It has the richness, with some of the
formality, of a flounce of old chenille embroidery,
such as in other years exercised the industry
and ingenuity of English ladies. This plant is
said to be called fumitory (earth-smoke, <i>fume
terre</i>) from the belief that it was produced without
seed from vapours arising from the earth.
This was an ancient and well-rooted belief as far
back as 1485. In Kent it is called ‘waxdolls,’
from the doll-like appearance of its little flowers.</p>

</div>


<h3 title="CHAPTER III.">IN THREE CHAPTERS.—CHAP. III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Five</span> minutes later, when my eyes were unbandaged,
I found myself being driven along a road
which was apparently in the extreme suburbs
of London, the houses that we passed were so
scattered and far apart. Legros was by my side,
and two other men were sitting opposite us; but
the windows of the conveyance were drawn up,
and although the night was now perfectly clear,
only the vaguest outlines were discernible of anything
outside, except for a moment now and
again when we came within the faint circle of
light radiated from an occasional street-lamp.
Suddenly my heart gave a great throb, for by
the momentary gleam of a lamp I saw that the
conveyance in which I was travelling was a
mourning-coach—a coach draped in black, and
such as is never made use of except for following
the dead. Could it be possible that the hearse
with its dread burden was in front of us, and
that we were following it to some bourn to me
unknown? I sank back into my corner, and
asked myself whether it was really true that I,
who had left my far-off country home scarcely
twenty-four hours ago, could thus suddenly, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">{313}</span>
without any action of my own, have become a
participant in some dire tragedy, of which as yet
I knew neither the beginning nor the end. I was
but a boy, just recovering from a long illness,
and if a few tears welled from my eyes in the
darkness, it is perhaps hardly to be wondered
at.</p>

<p>But it was of Karavich I was thinking more
than of myself. There was little doubt left in
my mind that the poor <i>cafetier</i> had come to some
foul and sudden end. But who and what was he,
and what was the nature of his crime? Who
were these men, who had constituted themselves
at once his judges and his executioners, and to
what place was the body of the murdered man
being conveyed so mysteriously in the dead of
night? Vain questions one and all. A sense sat
heavily upon me of being in the power of an
inexorable Destiny, who was leading me onward
whether I willed it or no, by paths to me unknown,
towards a goal I was unable to foresee.</p>

<p>Soon the last lamp was left behind, and we
plunged forward into the blacker darkness of the
country; and now our pace was increased, the
horses breaking into a long swinging trot, which
gradually became wearisome from its absolute
monotony. As on our first journey, not a word
was spoken by any one. By-and-by, from sheer
fatigue I suppose, perhaps aided in part by the
liqueur given me by Legros, I fell into a sort of
troubled sleep, in which the real and the imaginary
were strangely blended. How long this
state of semi-consciousness lasted, and how many
miles we travelled during the time, I had no
means of judging. The abrupt stoppage of the
coach, and the cessation of the monotonous grinding
of the wheels, brought me back with a start
to the realities of my position. Legros let down
one of the windows. Day was just breaking. A
dim misty light pervaded the atmosphere, through
which as yet nothing was clearly visible. M.
Legros and one of the others alighted and went
forward, leaving me and the other man inside.</p>

<p>‘Are we near the end of our journey?’ I said
to the silent figure sitting opposite me.</p>

<p>He started, stared at me for a moment, and
then made some unintelligible reply. Presently
the coach moved forward a little way, and then
halted again. Then M. Legros came up, and
standing on the carriage step, spoke to me through
the window.</p>

<p>‘Another stage of our journey is at an end,’ he
said. ‘We have one more stage to travel together
before we separate. You will now please to alight;
but before doing this, I must ask you to give me
your promise that neither by word nor gesture
will you endeavour to attract the attention or
rouse the suspicions of any strangers, not of our
party, whom you may presently see. As I have
already told you, you have only to obey my
instructions implicitly, and no harm shall befall
you.—Have I your word, monsieur?’ There was
a stern questioning look in his eyes as he finished
speaking.</p>

<p>‘I am helpless, and in your power; I can only
do as you wish.’</p>

<p>‘It is well,’ he said as he stepped down and
opened the carriage door.</p>

<p>I was glad enough to get out and be able to
stretch my cramped limbs. The other man followed,
and during the next few minutes he and
M. Legros kept close to me, one walking on either
side of me.</p>

<p>My first glance round showed me that we had
alighted some twenty or thirty yards from a
broad, sluggish-flowing river, which I at once said
to myself could be none other than the Thames.
A thin white mist lay on the water, through
which only the faintest outlines of the opposite
shore were discernible. In mid-stream, a small
steamer lay moored, from the funnel of which
a thin black pennon of smoke was lazily trailing.
We had alighted at a kind of wharf, roughly
paved and shut in by some half-dilapidated buildings,
which looked unspeakably forlorn and desolate
in the light of early morning. Some half-score
men, dressed in guernseys and high boots,
were lounging about, their hands buried deep in
their pockets, looking on with a stolidity which
it seemed as if nothing could rouse into animation,
at the proceedings of the party of which I formed
one, which were conducted without the slightest
pretence at secrecy. A little way in the background
stood the plumeless hearse with its two
black horses.</p>

<p>We three men, I in the middle, walked down
to the edge of the wharf. The tide was low; and
it was not till we were close to the water that
I perceived a couple of boats which seemed to be
waiting our arrival. The first looked like an
ordinary ship’s boat; in it were seated some half-dozen
men resting on their oars, with a cockswain
in the stern. The second boat was a broad old-fashioned
tub; but I could not repress a shudder
when I saw the coffin which had been brought
down in the hearse laid along its bottom. Two
men were in this boat, one seated at the head,
and the other at the foot, of the coffin.</p>

<p>There was barely time to note all this before,
in compliance with a whispered word from
Legros, who still kept by my side, I descended
four or five slimy tide-washed steps, and stepped
into the first boat, followed closely by my companions.
As soon as we had seated ourselves,
a signal was given; the men dipped their oars,
and a moment later the ragged wharf and its
staring denizens were left behind. And now it
was I first became aware that we had the other
boat with its awful freight in tow. It glided after
us through the morning mist, as though the secret
it held was one from which we might never more
escape.</p>

<p>Our boat headed in a straight line from the
wharf. I had undergone so many surprises
during the last few hours that it was only one
more added to the number to find that our destination
was the steamer which was anchored out
in mid-stream. Five minutes later, I found
myself on board, and, at the invitation of Legros,
I at once followed him below. He conducted
me into a handsomely fitted up saloon, and then
left me. It could not have been more than a
few minutes after this when the engine gave its
first palpitating throb, and the third stage of my
strange journey had begun.</p>

<p>Whither were we bound? What would be the
duration of our voyage? And what possible
object could my captors have in taking me so far
away from home? These were questions that
put themselves to me again and again; and then
I thought of the fate of poor Karavich, and my
heart as I did so grew faint within me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">{314}</span></p>

<p>It was all an unfathomable mystery, and the
more I strove to find some ray of light to
guide me through its mazes, the more bewildered
I became. In order to relieve in some
measure the burden of my thoughts, I began
to peer through the port-holes of the cabin,
one after another; but there was little to be
seen to gratify my curiosity. A dim line of
desolate flats on the one hand; on the other,
an equally dreary expanse of far-reaching shore,
with here and there a few scattered buildings,
from some of which sprung huge chimneys, which
were already belching forth black volumes of
smoke to the morning air. It had begun to
rain by this time; but there seemed to be
scarcely the faintest breath of wind; the quick
soft pulsing of the engines told me that we
were now making rapid progress through the
water.</p>

<p>I had been about half an hour alone, when
I was rejoined by Legros. He was all smiles
and amiability. He gave me the impression of a
man from whose mind some burden which had
pressed heavily on it had been suddenly lifted.
There was no longer that strained intense look
in his eyes—that air of watchful suspicion which
had been so noticeable in him earlier on, had
altogether vanished. He was, if possible, more
of an enigma to me under this new aspect than
he had been before.</p>

<p>‘Your eyes have a drowsy look in them, my
friend,’ he said pleasantly. ‘First of all, you
must partake of some breakfast; and after that,
you shall sleep—sleep—sleep for the next dozen
hours, if it so please you. This little <i>appartement</i>
is set aside for your service so long as you favour
us with your company.’ As he spoke, he opened
one of a row of three or four doors, and disclosed
a tiny sleeping berth, fitted up and in
every respect ready for occupation, which looked
infinitely tempting to my tired eyes. I took
advantage of the opportunity to perform some
needful ablutions. When I re-entered the saloon,
breakfast was on the table. A minute later,
Legros and I were joined by two men whom
I had not seen before, together with one of the
men who had accompanied us inside the carriage.
The two strangers were in some kind of undress
uniform. Legros smilingly introduced me to
them as a young English friend of his who had
taken a fancy to accompany them a little way
on their voyage. They replied by a few polite
words in English, in which they expressed a
hope that my voyage would prove a pleasant
one; but polite though their words might be,
I thought I detected under them a hidden ring
of sarcasm. After this, the conversation became
general, except as far as I was concerned, it
being conducted in the same unknown language
as before.</p>

<p>When I sat down at table, I seemed to have
no appetite, but it came with the occasion, and
despite the doubts and fears which beset me,
I made a hearty meal. When the others rose,
I retired to my berth, and in less than ten
minutes was sound asleep. It was on the point
of three o’clock when I awoke. On gazing out
through the port-hole, nothing could be seen but a
slowly heaving expanse of waters, through which
we were quickly cleaving our way. A dreary
drizzle of rain was still falling. On entering the
saloon, I found M. Legros lounging on the
couch over a novel and a cigarette. ‘Ah, ha!
you look better, much better,’ he said with a
nod and a smile. ‘I advise you to do as I am
doing. It’s the only thing on a day like this.
Here are cigarettes, and on that shelf you will
find some half hundred novels in half-a-dozen
languages. You can of course go on deck if you
wish to do so and prefer a wet coat to a dry one.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ I said. ‘I will try what it’s
like on deck—at least for a little while. The
fresh air will do me good.’</p>

<p>Of a truth, there was not much to keep any
one long on deck. A man at the wheel, an
officer on the bridge, and two seamen forward,
all in oilskins, were the only living beings
visible. After lighting a cigar, I found a sheltered
nook under the lee of one of the boats.
As far as my defective geographical knowledge
allowed me to judge, we were now somewhere
about the mouth of the Thames and heading
towards the North Sea. On our left, mile after
mile of low-lying desolate shore was dimly discernible
through the thin drizzle of rain. This
I concluded must be some portion of the Essex
coast. On our right, the gray heaving waters
stretched out into infinitude. Already the dull
November afternoon was darkening to its close.
From minute to minute, my spirits within me
seemed to be sinking deeper and deeper; the
gloom and desolation of the great waste of
waters seemed but a reflex of the gloom and
disquietude of my own thoughts. In a little
while I flung away the end of my cigar and
went below. M. Legros was no longer there;
I had the saloon to myself. It was necessary
to pass the time somehow, so, after making
choice of a book, I stretched myself on a
sofa and made a resolute attempt to read.
It was a vain effort. Karavich’s melancholy
deep-set eyes and white face blotted out the
printed words.</p>

<p>After a time, the steward appeared and began
his preparations for dinner. He was a sandy-haired,
foxy-faced man, with a retreating chin
and prominent teeth. I went on, pretending to
read, and taking but little or no notice of him;
when presently I was startled by a low warning
‘Hist!’ and on glancing up, I saw that the man
was regarding me with a strangely earnest look.
When he perceived that he had attracted my
attention, he held up a finger, as if in warning,
and then said in a whisper, that was a strange
jumble of broken English interlarded with
French, such as I cannot attempt to reproduce:
‘Do not appear to notice me, monsieur,
nor speak to me aloud, for the love of
heaven!’</p>

<p>I stared at him in astonishment, but so far
obeyed his adjuration as to remain silent.</p>

<p>‘Monsieur is an Englishman,’ he began again
presently, but still in a whisper so low that
only with difficulty could I make out what he
said; ‘and his kind heart will not allow him
to refuse to do a small service for one who is
in great extremity. Is it not so?’</p>

<p>‘Before I can promise, I must know what
the service is that you want me to do,’ I whispered
back.</p>

<p>‘It is only to post a certain letter after
monsieur’s arrival in London.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">{315}</span></p>

<p>I could not repress a start. ‘But how soon
am I likely to be back in London?’ I asked
with an eagerness I could not conceal.</p>

<p>‘If all goes well, in less than twenty-four
hours from now.’</p>

<p>Here, indeed, was joyful tidings; but I suppose
I must have looked somewhat incredulous, for
a moment later the man added: ‘Monsieur will
find that what I tell him is the truth.’</p>

<p>‘In that case, of course, I shall be quite
willing to post any letter you may intrust to
my care.’</p>

<p>‘O monsieur, thanks—a thousand thanks!’
replied the man in a tone the sincerity of which
I could not doubt. ‘If Monsieur Karavich could
do so, he would thank monsieur in person,
because it is he who is the writer of the
letter.’</p>

<p>‘Monsieur Karavich!’ I exclaimed aloud. ‘I
thought that’——</p>

<p>The clatter of a dozen knives on the table
drowned my voice. The steward had turned
as white as a sheet. ‘For the love of heaven,
monsieur, do not speak above a whisper,’ he said
after a pause and a frightened look round.
‘What I am doing now is at the risk of my
life—but that matters little. No; Monsieur
Karavich is not dead. To avoid any dangerous
questions being asked, he was brought down
here as if he were a dead man in a coffin made
for the purpose. Oh, but it was cunningly contrived!
Of all Monsieur Karavich’s friends, no
one knew—there was not one to warn him.’</p>

<p>Before I could say anything further, he had
left the cabin, but he was back again in the
course of two or three minutes. ‘Here is the
letter, monsieur,’ he said, still in a whisper.
‘The thanks of ten, of twenty, of fifty thousand
brave hearts would be yours, if they knew the
service you have promised to do. In less than
fifty hours, it will be known in every capital
in Europe that Fedor Karavich is a prisoner.’</p>

<p>I took the letter and put it away in an inner
pocket of my vest. ‘No eyes but mine shall
see the letter. I will post it with my own
hands as soon as I reach London. But tell me—who
and what <i>is</i> Monsieur Karavich?’</p>

<p>‘One of the greatest and noblest of men, and
a true patriot, if ever there was one. Monsieur
Karavich is not his real name; he has twenty
different names for different occasions. By birth
he belongs to one of the noblest families in
his native land; but his heart, his life, his
fortune, have been given to the poor and
oppressed. His real name is a name of terror
wherever tyranny hides and trembles.’</p>

<p>‘And what will be his fate, now that his
enemies have got him in their clutches?’</p>

<p>‘Who can tell? It is not the first time the
Bear has had him in its grip. He passed ten
years in Siberia when little more than a boy.
<i>Probablement</i>, he will disappear—vanish utterly,
and be heard of never again.’</p>

<p>‘Is there no way of helping him? Are there
no means of rescuing him?’</p>

<p>The man spread his hands with a gesture
eloquent of despair. ‘There is no hope—none,’
he answered with a half-sob in his voice. There
was silence for a few moments, then I noticed
his strange face lighten, and coming close to me,
he said in a lower whisper than before: ‘And
yet, monsieur, who can tell? Fedor Karavich
has friends where none would expect to find
them—friends secret, but devoted to the cause,
even amongst the highest of the high. All that
gold can do, all that powerful influence unseen
and working in the dark, can do for him will
be done; but after all’—— He finished with a
despondent shake of the head.</p>

<p>‘The cause, as you call it, seems to have its
emissaries everywhere,’ I remarked. ‘Even you
yourself’—— I paused. If an apparition had
suddenly stood before the man, he could scarcely
have looked more scared. He gave a great gasp,
but did not speak.</p>

<p>A moment later, we heard the sound of footsteps.
As M. Legros entered by one door, the
steward disappeared through another. I became
at once immersed in my novel.</p>

<p>The same party sat down to dinner that had
met at breakfast. Each of them addressed a few
words to me in English, and treated me with
the utmost courtesy; but, as before, the chief
part of the conversation was kept up in a language
of which I knew nothing. When dinner
was over, cigarettes and cards were introduced,
and I was invited by M. Legros to form one in
a rubber of whist. This, however, I declined to
do, and went back to my book instead. And so
a couple of hours sped quietly away.</p>

<p>At length I said to M. Legros: ‘If you have
no objection, and these gentlemen will not think
it rude on my part, I will retire to my berth.’</p>

<p>‘Do so by all means,’ he answered. ‘But if
I were you, I would only partially undress. It
is by no means unlikely that you may be called
in a hurry.’</p>

<p>About four hours later, I was called in a
hurry. A tap came to my door, and the voice
of Legros said: ‘Are you awake, monsieur?
If so, be good enough to dress as quickly as
possible.’</p>

<p>Five minutes later I joined him in the saloon.</p>

<p>‘I am grieved to say that we are about to
lose the pleasure of your company,’ he observed
in his blandest tones. ‘Whatever my regrets
may be, I am afraid that I can scarcely expect
you to share them; but it is just possible that
we may have the felicity of meeting again on
some future occasion. In any case, we shall
hardly fail to remember each other. Wrap this
cloak around you; I trust you will accept it
at my hands as a slight souvenir of our acquaintance;
and put this flask of cognac in your pocket;
you will find the night-air cold on the water.—And
now for a few last words of caution.’ His
brows contracted and his face seemed to darken
a little as he went on: ‘For your own sake,
and if you value your future welfare—nay, what
do I say, if you value life itself—you will not
speak one word to any living being of that which
you have seen and heard during the past few
hours. Should we find the authorities in London
setting on foot certain inquiries, we shall feel
assured that any information they may have
acquired can only have emanated from you. In
that case—— But I feel sure I need not say
more, except that I wish you to believe that my
warning is intended for your good. And now,
<i>cher</i> monsieur, if you are ready.’</p>

<p>I followed him on deck like a man in a dream.
I had not noticed till now that the screw of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">{316}</span>
steamer had ceased to revolve and that we were
scarcely moving through the water. The night
was bright and starlit. ‘Yonder little vessel—what
you English, I believe, call a fishing-smack—will
be your home for the next hour or two,’
said M. Legros, pointing to a dark object some
little distance away. ‘It will convey you to the
nearest port, from which you will readily make
your way to London.’ He took my hand and
held it with a hearty grip. ‘And now, adieu,
and <i>bon voyage</i>.’ Then in a whisper: ‘Remember
my warning. In a pocket of the cloak you
will find money to defray your expenses to
London.’</p>

<p>They were his last words to me. A moment
later I was being transferred in a small boat from
the steamer to the smack. Even before I got
aboard the latter, the steamer was under way
again. We could see her lights for a little while
after she herself was lost to view, then they, too,
were swallowed up in the darkness.</p>

<p>The crew of the smack consisted of three men
and a boy. They were a rough but kindly set,
and did their best under the circumstances to
make me comfortable. I asked them no questions,
nor did they ask me any. No doubt, M.
Legros had paid them well for the service they
had undertaken to perform. Soon after daybreak
they put me ashore at Lowestoft, and by
noon I found myself in London. I at once
took a cab and drove off to my friend Gascoigne’s
lodgings, only stopping for a moment by the way
to post poor Karavich’s letter. I had an impression,
but it may have been groundless, that my
movements were watched and followed both at
Lowestoft and in London.</p>

<p>I had not been an hour in Gascoigne’s company
before I had so far disobeyed M. Legros’
warning as to have told my friend everything.
At my age, it could not well have been otherwise;
the burden of such a secret was too heavy
for my young shoulders to bear. But I had no
desire to share it with any one else: once I had
told the story to my friend, I felt that I could
hold my tongue for ever.</p>

<p>Three days later, in the dusk of evening, Gascoigne
and I strolled down the street to a certain
house in which Karavich’s note had been addressed.
We found the number readily enough.
The ground-floor was a baker’s shop with an
unmistakable English name on the sign—certainly
not the name on Karavich’s letter. In
the window was a card inscribed: ‘First and
Second Floors to let Unfurnished;’ and sure
enough, on looking up we saw four uncurtained
windows staring blankly into the dark like so
many sightless eyes. We made no inquiry at
the shop, but hurried away, feeling as if we had
touched the verge of another mystery.</p>

<p>One evening, early in the following spring, I
was standing gazing into a jeweller’s window in
Bond Street, when a passing stranger halted, apparently
with the view of following my example.
I was conscious of his presence, but that was all.
I did not even glance at him. Suddenly a voice
whispered in my ear: ‘Fedor Karavich has
escaped; let his enemies beware!’ I turned
with a start, but only to see a tall dark-clothed
figure striding swiftly away.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Before these lines see the light, twelve thousand
miles of ocean will intervene between me and
the readers of them. Had it not been so, in
all probability the strange experience embodied
therein would never have been made public.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ON_PREVENTION_OF_BLINDNESS_IN">ON PREVENTION OF BLINDNESS IN
THE NEW-BORN.</h2>
</div>
<p class="ph3">BY A MEMBER OF THE OPHTHALMOLOGICAL SOCIETY.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the grandest of our charitable institutions
may be counted those for the care and instruction
of the blind. Their utility and the benefit they
confer are beyond question, and they are in the
highest degree deserving of moral and material
support. It is fortunate that human sympathy
is seldom slow in extending itself to those, be
they young or old, who have lost the priceless
boon of vision and who dwell in ‘eternal night.’
Whilst this is the case, however, and it is a
matter for thankfulness, it is well to remember
that ours is peculiarly an age when prevention
is held to be better than cure, and when considered
in connection with cases that admit of
‘no cure,’ the wisdom of pursuing a course of
‘prevention’ is only too evident.</p>

<p>It is well known that a large number of
the inmates of our blind institutions have been
rendered fit objects for admission by preventable
causes. The purpose the writer has now before
him is the consideration of a class of such
preventable cases, but which also embraces the
largest proportion. It is peculiarly a subject on
which the public need information, and by the
acquirement and diffusion of which knowledge,
it will be within their power to do an amount
of good, and which will tend in some degree
to lessen the number blinded in the manner to
be now described.</p>

<p>The class of cases to which reference is made
are those of young babies, to whom, in consequence
of a serious inflammation occurring
within a few days after birth, the light of the
world may be taken away from them, almost,
indeed, before their eyes have opened to it. The
disease is principally, but by no means exclusively
found among the poorer people; and as
it is among them that ignorance mostly prevails,
the direst results are most frequently
witnessed. The affection—setting-in a few days
after birth—is characterised by a discharge of
matter from the eyes, and attended with redness
and swelling, generally, of the eyelids.
Whilst on the one hand it must be strongly
urged that such a condition is a serious one,
on the other it must be equally recognised that
if treated sufficiently early it is amenable to
remedies. No mother of a babe should, on
noticing the appearances indicated, delay sending
for or taking her child to a medical man.
The grossest ignorance, however, prevails among
mothers and those surrounding them, as to
the gravity of this affection, at the time and
after the births of their children. The writer
in his medical practice experiences few circumstances
more sad, and calculated to harrow
one’s feelings more keenly, than for a baby to
be brought for the first medical treatment
when the disease has already wrought such havoc
as to render a cure an improbability, and too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">{317}</span>
often an impossibility. Such instances are of
frequent occurrence in hospital practice. Dr
Emrys-Jones some time ago collected statistics as
to the condition of the eyes when brought for
treatment at the Manchester Royal Eye Hospital;
and he found six and a quarter per cent. of the
eyes were hopelessly lost, in some cases both
eyes, in others one only. There is, moreover,
an amazing degree of careless indifference displayed,
and when a case in a wretched condition
is seen by a medical man for the first
time at the end of one, two, or three weeks
after the onset of the affection, to the question,
‘What have you been doing all this time for the
baby’s eyes?’ will come the reply: ‘Why,
nothing, sir;’ as if a special virtue lay in a negative
answer.</p>

<p>The importance of preventing blindness being
caused by this disease will be evident, when
it is asserted that a third or more of all cases
in the blind schools of England have been
occasioned by it. Nor, indeed, does this in any
manner show its entire effects; for those who have
only lost one eye through it, would, of course, be
omitted from calculation, as well as those whose
vision had been affected in a less degree. On
the continent, the proportion would appear to be
equally large. In Germany, Reinhard, from investigations
at twenty-two German blind asylums,
found six hundred and fifty-eight blind from this
disease among a total of twenty-one hundred
and sixty-five, or thirty and a half per cent.
Observations among our own institutions would
appear to represent as large or a larger percentage
of cases. The writer has kept a record
of children admitted into a teaching institution
with which he is connected, and the number
in his notebook is sixty-two. Of this number
he excludes seven, as either not having been
examined by him, or the cause of blindness
not verified; but of the remaining fifty-five,
in no fewer than twenty-one is this affection
distinctly traceable as the cause of blindness.
This gives a percentage of about thirty-nine.
No words, it would appear, can be necessary
to add to the telling effect of such figures.</p>

<p>It must be recollected, moreover, that the blind
are not only shut off from the pleasures of this
world, but their unhappy lot too frequently
renders them a necessary burden on their more
fortunate sight-possessing fellows. It is desirable
that a knowledge of the dreadful results following
a neglect of this disease should be impressed
upon the community. The results mentioned
comparatively seldom occur among the well-to-do,
for the reason that the doctor is in immediate
attendance, and under skilful treatment
the affection is cured; but, however, by extending
information on this subject, it will, it is hoped,
reach the less fortunately situated. A comprehensive
plan for attaining such an object was
introduced to the notice of the Ophthalmological
Society of the United Kingdom, by Dr
David M‘Keown of Manchester. He proposed
to utilise the poor-law and birth registration
organisations. Such a plan would enable every
mother of new-born infants to have read to her,
and to be put in possession of, or of whoever
may be in attendance, a card specifying the
characters and dangers of the disease; and
again, as the birth of every child has to be
registered within a certain number of days,
another opportunity would be afforded for giving
a card with the desired information. The card,
it was proposed, should run in this way:
‘<i>Instructions regarding new-born infants.</i>—If the
child’s eyelids become red and swollen, or begin
to run matter within a few days after birth, it
is to be taken without a day’s delay to a doctor.
The disease is very dangerous; and if not at
once treated, may destroy the sight of both
eyes.’</p>

<p>The Society, on the Report of its Committee
on this subject, adopted, with slight modifications,
the series of resolutions suggested by Dr
M‘Keown. The first resolution of the Society,
and which chiefly concerns us here, was as
follows: ‘That the purulent ophthalmia of new-born
infants being the cause of a vast amount
of blindness, mainly because of the ignorance
of the public regarding its dangerous character,
and the consequent neglect to apply for timely
medical aid, it is desirable to instruct those in
charge of new-born children by a card’ (as previously
mentioned). This is to be distributed,
the resolution adds, by the poor-law and birth
registration organisations of the United Kingdom;
and details the methods to be adopted for
carrying the plan into operation. In a subsequent
resolution, the aid of the medical press
is solicited, and the attention of the various
institutions which train or employ midwives
is drawn to this very important subject.</p>

<p>These resolutions, as it has been said, were
adopted by the Ophthalmological Society; and
they were desired to be communicated to the
Presidents of the Local Government Board, and
of similar bodies in Scotland and Ireland. A
deputation also was appointed to wait upon the
Presidents of these bodies, if necessary, to urge
the desirability of the plan sketched out being
put into practice; and among other members
of this deputation were Sir William Bowman,
and the President (Mr Jonathan Hutchinson) of
the Society.</p>

<p>It is very much to be hoped that the action
of such an influential Society will have a good
effect. It clearly puts the gravity of the case
before the public; and any individual who can
in any way spread the knowledge contained in
the foregoing Report will be engaged in a really
good cause.</p>

<p>For some time, the Society for the Prevention
of Blindness has issued and circulated a
leaflet entitled, ‘Advice to Mothers who do not
wish their Children to be Blind.’ It contains
sound directions as to the nature of the disease,
its recognition, and hints as to what should be
done whilst the doctor is being fetched, which
should, however, be by no means delayed. Any
one interested in the welfare of the blind, and
wishing for further information as to the objects
of the Society, should communicate with Dr
Roth, Secretary, 48 Wimpole Street, London, W.</p>

<p>The object the writer has had in view in this
article has been to draw attention to this affection
of babies’ eyes, and to enforce the urgent
necessity for prompt and proper treatment.
He has not inserted any directions as to
remedies parents may themselves employ, because
it is essentially a disease that no one but
a medical man should treat, and parents should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">{318}</span>
be encouraged to apply at once for relief. For
the very poor, in every town is a hospital or
dispensary, to which the infant can be taken.
The better-to-do should seek the services of
their own doctor. Whilst saying this, however,
it may be observed that cleanliness is of the
greatest importance; and this should be regarded
both as to the infant’s surroundings and also
as to the eyes, in cleansing them with <i>clean</i>
tepid water frequently, of all discharge; and this
requires to be done very gently. At the time
of the birth of the baby, also, the eyes are the
first parts that should be washed clean, and not
left until the last, as is not unfrequently the
case. If this were done, the disease in many
cases would be prevented.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edmund Burke</span>, the distinguished orator and
writer, at the close of an election in 1774, in an
eloquent speech, thanked his constituents for
electing him as their member. He was followed
by his colleague, Mr Cruger, a merchant, who,
after the orator’s remarks, contented himself by
exclaiming: ‘Gentlemen, I say ditto to Mr
Burke!’</p>

<p>Two stories are told of Lord Brougham. On
being offered the post of Chief Baron of the
Exchequer, Brougham refused it, alleging that
its acceptance would prevent the continuance
of his parliamentary duties. ‘True,’ rejoined
Canning; ‘but you will be only one stage from
the woolsack.’—‘Yes,’ said Brougham; ‘but the
horses will be off.’</p>

<p>The second is contained in a remark of Sydney
Smith, who, seeing Brougham in a carriage on
the panel of which was the letter B. surmounted
by a coronet, observed: ‘There goes a carriage
with a B outside and a wasp inside.’</p>

<p>Lord Erskine had the following unique form of
replying to begging letters: ‘Sir—I feel honoured
by your application, and I beg to subscribe’—here
the recipient had to turn over the leaf—‘myself,
your very obedient servant.’</p>

<p>Lord Palmerston’s good-humour as a distinct
element of his character is well known. We find
it even during his last illness, when his physician
was forced to mention death. ‘Die, my dear
doctor!’ he exclaimed; ‘that’s the <i>last</i> thing I
shall do.’</p>

<p>When Shiel had learned by heart, but failed
to remember, the exordium of a speech beginning
with the word ‘Necessity,’ which he repeated
three times, Sir Robert Peel continued: ‘Is not
<i>always</i> the mother of invention.’</p>

<p>Some good sayings are attributed to George
Selwyn, who was called ‘the receiver-general of
wit and stray jokes,’ and was a silent member
of parliament for many years. When told that
Sir Joshua Reynolds intended to stand for parliament,
Selwyn replied: ‘Sir Joshua is the ablest
man I know on a canvas.’</p>

<p>Horace Walpole, when complaining one day
of the existence of the same indecision, irresolution,
and want of system, in the reign of
George III. as had been witnessed in that of
Queen Anne, remarked concerning the continuance
of the Duke of Newcastle as First Lord
of the Treasury after the accession of George
III.: ‘There is nothing new under the sun.’—‘Nor
under the grandson,’ added Selwyn, George
III. being the grandson of George II.</p>

<p>George III. one day alluded to Selwyn as
‘that rascal George;’ on which Selwyn asked:
‘What does that mean?’ Immediately adding:
‘Oh, I forgot; it is one of the hereditary titles
of the Georges.’</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland on asking Selwyn
how a horse he had lately purchased answered,
received the reply: ‘I really don’t know; I have
never asked him a question.’</p>

<p>When it was proposed at one time to tax
coals instead of iron, Sheridan objected to the
proposal on the ground that ‘it would be a jump
from the frying-pan into the fire.’</p>

<p>Many other examples might be given of
Sheridan’s wit; we shall mention three. On
meeting one day two royal dukes, one of them
said that they had just been discussing whether
Sheridan were a greater fool than knave. The
wit, placing himself between them, quickly
replied: ‘Why, faith, I believe I’m between the
two.’ His son said that were he in parliament,
he would write on his forehead, ‘To let.’—‘Add
“unfurnished,”’ suggested the father. On another
occasion, when asked by his tailor for at least
the interest of his bill, Sheridan replied: ‘It
is not my interest to pay the principal, nor my
principle to pay the interest.’</p>

<p>With this last we may compare Talleyrand’s
method in dealing with creditors. When asked
by one when he should receive payment, the
only answer given was: ‘<i>Ma foi</i>, how inquisitive
you are!’</p>

<p>We shall draw this paper to a close by quoting
from <i>The Anecdotal History of Parliament</i> the
following:</p>

<p>‘<i>An Irish Election Bill.</i>—The following bill
was sent by an innkeeper at Trim to Sir Mark
Somerville, who had given an order that all
persons who voted for him in a contested election
for Meath should be boarded and lodged
at his expense. The bill, it is said, is still kept
in a frame at the family seat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BREAD_FROM_THE_BARK_OF_THE">BREAD FROM THE BARK OF THE
FIR-TREE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> present century is marked by a great social
improvement in the position of the lower or
working classes; the days of famine, from which
they suffered so severely, have passed away, and
they can now rely upon bread made wholly from
corn, free from husk and chaff, and of that fine
quality which a century ago was a luxury only
indulged in by the upper or wealthier classes.
This improvement has been brought about by
a fuller cultivation of the land and by a general
development of trade—great social changes which
are the spirit or essence of civilisation.</p>

<p>In England, the white bread of the poor man
is a thing of this century; whole-meal or brown-bread,
barley-bread, and oatcake being their old
form of food.</p>

<p>In the last century, when the wood-trade of
the Baltic was confined to the Russian ports, the
now thriving towns in the Gulf of Bothnia were
poor fishing-villages, and the bread of the people
was commonly made from the inner bark of
the fir-tree. Their staple grain was oats and
rye; but in time of scarcity, bark-bread was
used; at other times, bark-meal was mixed with
corn-meal, as a matter of economy. As the
making of bark-bread may now be termed a
lost art, we propose to give a few notes upon it,
which cannot fail to be of interest to the general
reader.</p>

<p>Until recently, the making of bark-bread
from the fir-tree was common in the north of
Sweden and Norway and in the north-western
parts of Finland. The bark was stripped from
the trees in the spring, the only time of the
year it is easily removable; that of the trunk of
large trees was most preferred, as it was less
strong than the bark of small trees or branches.
Linnæus, the great naturalist, when passing
through the woods of Helsingland, in Sweden, in
1732, says: ‘The common and spruce firs grow
here to a very large size. The inhabitants had
stripped almost every tree of its bark.’ The
outer or hard scaly bark was carefully removed,
as the inner bark was the only part required.
The bark was then dried in the sun, and stored
for winter use, a season that embraces six or
seven months of the year. Preparatory to grinding,
the bark was rendered friable, thick, and
porous by being warmed over a slow fire. It
was then in part given to their swine in a
granulated form, by way of economising corn, the
swine by this food being rendered extremely fat.
Other parts were cut up obliquely and given
to their cows, goats, and sheep. When ground,
this bark-meal, as it was called, was stored in
barrels.</p>

<p>The following is an old recipe for making it
into bread: ‘The meal is moistened with cold
water into a paste or dough, without being
allowed to go into a state of fermentation, and
without any yeast. Cold water is preferred to
warm, the latter rendering the dough too brittle.
The dough being of a soft consistence, is then
well kneaded on a table. A handful is sufficient
to make one cake, though no person would
suppose that so small a quantity could make so
large a cake as afterwards appears. This lump
of dough is spread out on a flat table, not with a
rolling-pin, but with the hands, and a flat trowel
or shovel; a considerable quantity of flour is
sprinkled over the surface, and the whole mass
is extended until it becomes as thin as a skin
of parchment. It is then turned by means of a
very large shovel, after being previously pricked
all over with an instrument made on purpose,
and composed of a large handful of the wing
feathers of ptarmigan, partridge, or some such
birds. The other side, when turned uppermost,
is subsequently pricked in the same manner.
The cake is then put into the oven, only one
being ever baked at a time. The attendance of
a person is necessary to watch the cake, and
move or lift it up occasionally, that it may not
burn. Much time, indeed, is not required for
the baking. When sufficiently done, the cake
is hung over some kind of rail, and the two
sides hang down parallel to each other. Other
cakes when baked are hung near to, or over, the
first. When the whole are finished, they are
laid by one upon another in a large heap, until
wanted.’</p>

<p>The dough was said to be more compact than
barley, and almost as much so as rye; but the
bread was noted as being rather bitter in taste.</p>

<p>Mr Laing, in his <i>Journal of a Residence in
Norway</i>, states that he had been disposed to
doubt the use of fir-bark for bread; but he found
it more extensive than is generally supposed.
In Norway, it is the custom to kiln-dry oats to
such a degree that both the grain and the
husks are made into a meal almost as fine as
wheaten flour. In bad seasons, the inner bark
of young Scotch pines is kiln-dried in a similar
manner to the oats, and ground along with
them, so as to add to the quantity of the meal.
The present dilapidated state of the forests in
districts which formerly supplied wood for exportation,
is ascribed to the great destruction of
young trees for this purpose in the year 1812.
The bread baked of the oat and pine meal is
said to be very good. It is made in the form
of ‘flat cakes, covering the bottom of a girdle
or frying-pan, and as thin as a sheet of paper,
being put on the girdle in nearly a fluid state.’
When used at table, these cakes are made crisp
by being warmed a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">{320}</span></p>

<p>It would appear that the inner bark of the
silver birch-tree is also used for grinding into
bark-meal. Loudon says in his <i>Arboretum Britannicum</i>:
‘In Kamtschatka, the inner bark of
the birch is dried and ground, like that of the
Scotch pine, in order to mix it with oatmeal,
in times of scarcity. It is also said to be eaten
in small pieces along with the roe of fish.’ The
Rev. Dr Brewer, in his <i>Dictionary of Phrase and
Fable</i>, says: ‘In the fifteenth century, Christopher
III. of Scandinavia, in a time of great scarcity,
had the bark of birch wood mixed with meal
for food, from which circumstance he was called
“The King of Bark.”’</p>

<p>It is quite clear that the birch is wholesome,
for in the Baltic Provinces it is customary for
women in the streets to sell birch-sap in pails
to the cry of <i>birk vatten</i> (birch-water); and we
are told in the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i> that ‘during
the siege of Hamburg by the Russians in 1814,
almost all the birch-trees in the neighbourhood
were destroyed by the Boshkirs and other barbarian
soldiers in the Russian service, by being
tapped for their sap.’</p>

<p>In the old home of bark-bread, wheat and
oats are practically unknown, the shortness of
the summer not admitting of the ripening of
these cereals. The inhabitants are consequently
confined to barley and rye, the latter being their
staple food. This rye-bread is dark in colour,
but very sweet and wholesome.</p>

<p>We have seen the bakers of Sweden drawing
batches of rye-bread; and from the sweetness of
it and its appearance as it lined the floor of
the bakehouse, we could scarcely disabuse our
minds that it was not a batch of English plum-loaf.</p>

<p>The making of bark-bread may now be said
to be a thing of the past; but its use even so
late as the first half of this century, points to
a primitive age, and an intensity in the struggle
for life with which we in England are wholly
unacquainted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak smallertext" id="THE_STANHOPE_GOLD_MEDAL">THE STANHOPE GOLD MEDAL.</h2>
</div>


<p>In this <i>Journal</i> for June 6, 1885, we gave
our readers some account of the ‘Heroes of
Peace’ whose gallant acts had been rewarded in
the course of the previous year by the Royal
Humane Society. The Stanhope Gold Medal—‘the
“blue ribbon” of the Society’—is awarded
early in each year to the hero of the most praiseworthy
instance of bravery brought to the notice
of the Society during the preceding twelve months.
In the beginning of this year, then, the Stanhope
Medal was awarded to Alfred Collins, a young
fisherman of Looe, Cornwall, for an act of bravery
of such signal daring as to deserve special notice
here. On a dark stormy night of December 1884,
a boy named Hoskings fell overboard from the
fishing lugger <i>Water Nymph</i>, then seven or eight
miles south-east of the Eddystone lighthouse.
The captain of the boat, Alfred Collins, immediately
jumped overboard, hampered though he
was by his oilskins and sea-boots, and holding
on to his boat with one hand, endeavoured to
clutch the boy with the other. He failed in this
attempt; but clambering into the boat again, he
secured the end of a line, and carrying this with
him, he jumped overboard once more, and swam
in the direction of the sinking lad. There was
a heavy gale blowing, and the night was dark,
with heavy rain. By the time Collins reached
the boy, he was eighty feet from the <i>Water
Nymph</i>, and already three feet under water; but
Collins managed to clutch him, and the two were
with great difficulty pulled on board. Such self-sacrificing
heroism as this needs no commendation;
but the Royal Humane Society do well to
recognise it by the award of their medals. In
addition to the Stanhope Medal, the Society
awarded during last year fifteen silver medals,
and one hundred and thirty-nine bronze ones;
and to ten heroes who already wore the medal for
previous acts of bravery, the clasp was given;
while the minor awards, of testimonials on vellum
and parchment and of money, numbered no fewer
than two hundred and twenty-seven. In the
cases reported to the Society during the twelve
months, out of four hundred and thirty-nine
persons attempted to be rescued, four hundred
and six were actually saved.</p>
